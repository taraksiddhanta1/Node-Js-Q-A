Node Js Q&amp;A


### 1. What is Node.js?
Answer: Node.js is a JavaScript engine used for executing
JavaScript code outside the browser, commonly used to build
scalable backend applications.

### 2. What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a scripting language, while Node.js is a
runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server
side.

### 3. Is Node.js single-threaded?
Answer: Yes, Node.js is single-threaded but uses event-driven
architecture and non-blocking I/O to handle multiple requests
efficiently.

### 4. What kind of API function is supported by Node.js?
Answer: Node.js supports both synchronous (blocking) and
asynchronous (non-blocking) API functions.

### 5. What is a module in Node.js?
Answer: A module in Node.js is a block of code that provides
specific functionality, which can be reused across different parts
of an application.

### 6. What is npm and its advantages?
Answer: npm is the default package manager for Node.js,
offering benefits like dependency management, version control,
and a centralized repository.

### 7. What is middleware?
Answer: Middleware functions execute between the request and
response cycle, performing tasks like logging, authentication,
and data processing.

### 8. How does Node.js handle concurrency despite being
single-threaded?
Answer: Node.js handles concurrency through asynchronous,
non-blocking operations, allowing multiple tasks to run
simultaneously within a single thread.

### 9. What is control flow in Node.js?
Answer: Control flow refers to the order in which code
statements and functions are executed, managing asynchronous
operations and error handling.

### 10. What do you mean by event loop in Node.js?
Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that processes
asynchronous tasks in a single thread by continuously checking
for and executing callback functions.

### 11. What are the main disadvantages of Node.js?
Answer: Disadvantages include its single-threaded nature,
preference for NoSQL databases, and rapid API changes that can
cause instability.

### 12. What is REPL in Node.js?
Answer: REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop; it's an
interactive environment for executing Node.js code and
debugging.

### 13. How to import a module in Node.js?
Answer: Use the `require()` function to import external
modules, storing the result in a variable for use in the
application.

### 14. What is the difference between Node.js and AJAX?
Answer: Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, while
AJAX is a client-side technique for asynchronously updating parts
of a web page.

### 15. What is package.json in Node.js?
Answer: `package.json` is a metadata file in Node.js that
contains information about the project, such as dependencies,
scripts, and version.

### 16. What is the most popular Node.js framework used
these days?
Answer: The most popular Node.js framework is Express.js,
known for its scalability and minimalistic approach to building
web applications.

### 17. What are promises in Node.js?
Answer: Promises in Node.js are objects that handle
asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner alternative to
callback functions.

### 18. What is event-driven programming in Node.js?
Answer: Event-driven programming synchronizes multiple
events using event loops and callback functions to simplify
program flow.

### 19. What is buffer in Node.js?
Answer: A buffer is a temporary storage space for binary data,
allowing Node.js to handle raw data directly.

### 21. What are streams in Node.js?
Answer: Streams are objects used to handle continuous data
flows, allowing for efficient reading and writing of data.
